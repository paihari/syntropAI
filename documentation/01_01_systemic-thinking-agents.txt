SyntropAI series: Agents in Systemic Thinking

In this article, I explore three types of agents — biological, human, and AI — and what AI systems can learn from nature and society.

We look at how AI agents can go beyond automation and start thinking systemically:
🧠 Adaptive like biology
🤝 Collaborative like humans
⚙️ Scalable like real-world ecosystems

This is part of an ongoing article series that breaks down AI, infrastructure, FinOps, and governance in clear, structured terms.
