SyntropAI series: Empowered AI Agents

Building on series of article, this article explores what it means for AI agents to be autonomous, collaborative, and scalable — not just in theory, but in practice.

We look at how autonomy is being powered by LLMs, how protocols like MCP and A2A could redefine collaboration, and why modular design is key to scalable agent ecosystems.

This is part of a series that explains AI, infra, FinOps, and governance through clear, systemic thinking — not just system configs.
