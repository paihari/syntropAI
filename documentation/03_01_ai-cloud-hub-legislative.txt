SyntropAI series: AI Cloud Hub â€“ Legislative Arm Integration

This post shows how AI agents can be governed by policy, not scripts â€” applying rules like tagging, region control, cost limits, and subnet security before they act.

From CISO constraints to FinOps guardrails, the Legislative Arm enables autonomous infrastructure with real-time oversight â€” enforced through Slack, memory, and a simple rule engine.

ðŸŽ¥ Includes demos on policy-compliant provisioning and exception escalation.
