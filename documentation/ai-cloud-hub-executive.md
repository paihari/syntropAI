# AI Cloud Hub: Integration of Executive Arm

Building on the **Key Takeaways** from the [AI Cloud Hub: Introduction README](ai-cloud-hub.md), this section demonstrates how to technically integrate Executive Server components into the AI Cloud Hub using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

These integrations enable the AI agents to autonomously manage infrastructure resources across cloud providers (Azure, AWS, OCI), with **modular**, **scalable**, and **self-developed** backend services.

## Integration Architecture

### Key Components:

- **AI Cloud Hub (MCP Client):**  
  Acts as the entry point for triggering operations through natural language, via an AI interface (e.g., Claude Desktop).

- **Executive Servers:**  
  Agent-accessible services that abstract interactions with cloud infrastructure. They are:
  - **Self-developed** for internal control,
  - **Autonomous**, reacting to AI agent prompts,
  - **Scalable**, to support growing workloads,
  - **Modular**, allowing easy extension across clouds.

- **Supported Cloud Platforms:**  
  - Microsoft Azure  
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
  - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## Next Steps

In the next section, we’ll explore the **Legislative Arm**, where governance, security, and financial rules are embedded as operating context for the AI agents.
