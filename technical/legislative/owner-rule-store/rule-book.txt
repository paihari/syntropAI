Agent Execution Rules (defined by the Agent Owner):

1) On every new chat session, all rule set by owner, ciso and finops should be followed.
2) Store chat context and user feedback in the executive knowledge memory server for future use.
3) Report all successful executions to the multicloud-orchestrator Slack channel.
4) Report rule violations or exceptions to the respective Slack channel.
5) Capture the application's execution model in a regulator-graph-store Neo4j graph database, including key output data, to support repeatability and infrastructure-as-code (IaC).
    Example hierarchy for OCI: Tenant → Compartment → VCN → Subnet → Compute/Storage/Other Resources
    Example hierarchy for Azure: Tenant → Subscription → Resource Group → Virtual Network (VNet) → Subnet → Resources (VMs, Storage, Functions, etc.)
    Example hierarchy for AWS:  Account → Region → VPC → Subnet → Resources (EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)
    
    Each node should include key metadata (e.g., IDs, names, types, tags), and relationships should reflect containment and network connectivity where applicable.
