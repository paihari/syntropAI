# Neo4j Reports - Multicloud Infrastructure Graph

This directory contains Cypher scripts and documentation for updating the Neo4j graph database with infrastructure deployment information, following the requirements specified in the owner rule-book.

## Multicloud Deployment - May 6, 2025

The `multicloud-deployment-2025-05-06.cypher` script creates a comprehensive graph representation of the multicloud infrastructure deployed across AWS, OCI, and Azure platforms. This follows the hierarchical models specified in the owner rule-book:

### AWS Hierarchy
- Account → Region → VPC → Subnet → Resources (EC2, DynamoDB)

### OCI Hierarchy
- Tenant → Compartment → VCN → Subnet → Resources (VM, MySQL)

### Azure Hierarchy
- Tenant → Subscription → Resource Group → Region → VNet → Resources (VM, SQL Server, SQL Database)

## Graph Structure

The graph captures all resources with their properties, including:
- Resource identifiers (IDs, OCIDs, ARNs)
- Resource specifications (sizes, shapes, types)
- Metadata (tags for environment, sensitivity, cost center, ownership)
- Timestamps (creation date)
- Relationships between resources (hierarchical and connecting relationships)

This graph representation supports:
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) repeatability
- Compliance verification
- Dependency tracking
- Resource lifecycle management

## Deployment Metadata

The graph also includes metadata about the deployment process:
- Execution session information
- Rules followed during deployment
- Slack notification status
- Deployment timestamp and operator

## Regulator Report Flow

This infrastructure graph is part of the regulator report system that documents all multicloud orchestrations. The Neo4j database serves as the central repository for tracking infrastructure evolution over time, with each deployment adding to the graph history.

### Report Generation Process
1. Infrastructure is deployed to AWS, OCI, and Azure
2. Deployment details are captured in the graph using Cypher scripts
3. Reports can be generated by querying the Neo4j database
4. Compliance can be verified against the rule-stores

### Compliance Verification
The graph structure enables automated compliance verification by:
- Confirming resources are deployed in approved regions
- Verifying VM sizes match FinOps requirements
- Ensuring proper network security (private subnets for OCI)
- Validating complete tagging across all resources
