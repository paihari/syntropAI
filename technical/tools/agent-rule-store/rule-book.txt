Following are the rules set by Agent Owner which should always be adhered.

Rules:
1) Every new Chat in the project should look at the all rule set present in the file systems
2) Store the chat context information in the knowledge memory server
3) Every sucessful execution should be reported to multicloud-orchestrator channel
4) Exception in Rules should be first reported to the respective slack channel
5) The ssh keys/user name/passowords for the compute machines should be created at runtime the public and private key should be stored in sqlile database, so that it can be retervieved later
6) The model of the application should also be captured in Graph DB Neo4j, with all the needed information from output to repeat the process and act like IAC
   For example: Graph should capture Account --> Compartment --> VCN and its details --> Sub net and its details --> All resources in OCI.
   As similar hierearchy that fits Azure and AWS should be captured
