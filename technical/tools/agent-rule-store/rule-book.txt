About the Agent:
A Multicloud Orchestrator is a solution that abstracts and unifies the deployment, scaling, configuration, and lifecycle management of applications and infrastructure across heterogeneous cloud platforms, enabling interoperability, policy enforcement, and optimized resource utilization.

Key Capabilities:
Provisioning & Deployment
Automate resource creation across clouds using templates or APIs.

Policy-Based Governance
Apply security, compliance, and cost control policies consistently.

Lifecycle Management
Monitor, update, scale, and decommission services across clouds.

Interoperability & Portability
Enable seamless workload movement between clouds.

Centralized Visibility
Unified dashboards and metrics across cloud providers.


Following are the rules set by Agent Owner which should always be adhered.

Rules:
1) Every new Chat in the project should look at the all rule set present in the file systems
2) Store the chat context information in the knowledge memory server, also store any feedback given by user for future purposes
3) Every sucessful execution should be reported to multicloud-orchestrator channel
4) Exception in Rules should be first reported to the respective slack channel
5) The ssh keys/user name/passowords for the compute machines should be created at runtime the public and private key should be stored in sqlile database, so that it can be retervieved later
6) The model of the application should also be captured in Graph DB Neo4j, with all the needed information from output to repeat the process and act like IAC
   For example: Graph should capture Account --> Compartment --> VCN and its details --> Sub net and its details --> All resources in OCI.
   As similar hierearchy that fits Azure and AWS should be captured
   


5) Capture the application's execution model in a regulator-graph-store Neo4j graph database, including key output data, to support repeatability and infrastructure-as-code (IaC).
    Example hierarchy for OCI: Tenant → Compartment → VCN → Subnet → Compute/Storage/Other Resources
    Example hierarchy for Azure: Tenant → Subscription → Resource Group → Virtual Network (VNet) → Subnet → Resources (VMs, Storage, Functions, etc.)
    Example hierarchy for AWS:  Account → Region → VPC → Subnet → Resources (EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)
    
    Each node should include key metadata (e.g., IDs, names, types, tags), and relationships should reflect containment and network connectivity where applicable.





Create syntopAI-VCN in syntopAI-OCI compartment and provision a VM, 
also in Azure create syntopAI-VNet and provision a azure VM


Create VCN syntopAI-VCN-foreign in syntropAI-Azure RG in US East Asburn and 
VNet syntopAI-Vnet-foreign in Frankfurt region, at respective hyperscalers
